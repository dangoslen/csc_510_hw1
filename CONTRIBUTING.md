# Contributing to CSC 510 HW1

Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to contribute to our cool github repo.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to our demonstration of a good github repository structure. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [CSC 510 HW1 Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [chsmith3@ncsu.edu](mailto:chsmith3@ncsu.edu).

## How To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug while using our software, please report as a [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 

#### How Do I Submit A Bug Report?

Create an issue on the repository.
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Where possible, include screenshots and/or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community by creating a contributable environment

Please follow these steps to have your contribution reviewed by the maintainers:

1. Include a clear and descriptive title.
2. Include a description of the change.
3. Verify that all Travis-CI status checks are passing. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
